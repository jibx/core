      <h3><a name="custom">Using custom code with JiBX</a></h3>

<p>For the highest degree of control over JiBX binding behavior you can write
custom code that ties directly into the JiBX framework. This gives you
ways of handling special cases that are beyond the normal binding flexibility.
It's not a technique to be used lightly, though.</p>

<p>Working at this level takes you into the internals of the JiBX runtime
implementation classes. These implementation classes are considered to be
reasonably stable, but are likely to change more frequently then the interface
classes (in the <code>org.jibx.runtime</code> package) defined for normal user
access. They're also not as well documented as the normal user interface - all
you'll have to work with is this page, the associated example code, and the
JavaDocs for the implementation classes (in the
<code>org.jibx.runtime.impl</code> package).</p>

<p>Even with these limitations, the flexibility may be worth the pain involved
if you have special binding requirements. I've supplied a pair of examples here which
illustrate this flexibility. The JiBX custom code portions of these examples are
included in the <i>jibx-extras.jar</i> in the distribution, so they're available
for use without the need for you to personally dig into the JiBX implementation
code (unless you want to change the way they work).</p>

      <h3><a name="marunmar">Custom marshallers and unmarshallers</a></h3>

<p>The principle behind custom marshallers and unmarshallers is simple: Instead
of letting JiBX build a marshaller and
unmarshaller for a class based on a <b>mapping</b> element in your binding
definition, you tell JiBX to use your own supplied class. This class must
implement the <code>org.jibx.runtime.IMarshaller</code> (for a marshaller, used
by an output binding) and/or <code>org.jibx.runtime.IUnmarshaller</code> (for an
unmarshaller, used by an input binding) interfaces.</p>

<p>You can think of custom marshallers and unmarshallers as taking the simpler
idea of <a href="%bindextend%#serdeser"><b>custom serializers and
deserializers</b></a> to a whole new level. Serializers and deserializers give
you control over the text representation of primitive or simple object values,
where there's no XML structure involved. Custom marshallers and unmarshallers
extend this control to complex objects with any number of attributes and/or
child elements. The downside of this extended control is that marshallers and
unmarshallers are considerably more complex to code than serializers and
deserializers.</p>

<a name="figure21"><b>Figure 21. Using a custom marshaller/unmarshaller</b></a><br>
<img src="images/custom-marunmar.gif" width="600" height="386" alt="Using a custom marshaller/unmarshaller"/>

<p><a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a> shows a pair of examples of using a a custom
marshaller/unmarshaller. In this case the marshaller/unmarshaller involved handles
<code>java.util.HashMap</code> instances. The Java class structure is based off
a <code>Directory</code> that contains a <code>HashMap</code> (highlighted in
green) using customer identifier strings as keys and the associated customer
information (in the form of <code>Customer</code> class instances) as values.
The custom marshaller code converts the hashmap into a <b>map</b> element
wrapper with an attribute giving the number of key-value pairs, and the actual
key-value pairs as contained <b>entry</b> elements (all
highlighted in magenta). Each <b>entry</b> element gives the key as an
attribute and the mapped value as the content. The custom unmarshaller converts
this XML structure back into a hashmap instance.</p>

<p>The binding definitions in <a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a> show two
different ways of using a custom marshaller/unmarshaller class. In the top
version, the <b>mapping</b> definition highlighted in blue tells JiBX to
use the custom marshaller/unmarshaller by default for handling all
<code>java.util.HashMap</code> instances referenced by the binding. Here the
actual binding definition for the <b>customerMap</b> field (highlighted in
green) automatically uses the custom code. In the bottom version, the custom
marshaller and unmarshaller are instead referenced directly by the binding
definition for the field (again highlighted in green).</p>

<p>Hashmap handling makes an especially good example of the situations that
require custom marshaller/unmarshallers. This particular implementation handles
one particular form of hashmaps, with string keys and values of an object type
with a <b>mapping</b> definition within the JiBX binding file. Other forms
of hashmaps could be handled by modifying the basic marshaller/unmarshaller code,
but it's very difficult to handle all possible types of hashmaps with a single
implementation. Consider how the XML structure would need to be different if the
key values in the hashmap were other mapped objects rather than simple string
values, for instance (they couldn't be expressed in XML as attribute values, for
starters).</p>

<p>Below is a partial listing of the custom marshaller/unmarshaller class (with
only the marshaller implementation shown - see the <i>/tutorial/example21</i>
directory of the distribution for the full source code and related files):</p>

                } else {
                    throw new JiBXException("Mapped value is not marshallable");
                }

    ...
}</pre></div>

<p>At runtime, JiBX creates an instance of the class when needed using either a
default (no-argument) constructor or an optional <i>aliased</i> constructor that
uses element name information passed in from the JiBX binding. The difference
between the two is that the aliased constructor allows the element name to be
used by the marshaller/unmarshaller to be set by JiBX based on the information
in the binding definition file. For the <a href="#figure21">Figure 21</a>
example JiBX uses the aliased constructor behind the scenes, since the binding
definitions supply a name for the mapped element. If a custom marshaller or
unmarshaller class (which need not be the same class) supports setting the root
element name in this way it needs to implement the
<code>org.jibx.runtime.IAliasable</code> interface (which is only an indicator
interface, with no actual methods defined).</p>

<p>This naming flexibility only applies at the top level, though. As you can see
from the code, the local names used for the attributes and nested element name are
fixed at compile time, while the namespaces are all set to match that of the
aliased top-level element (which may not be what you want - often documents that
use namespaces for elements do not use them for attributes, for instance).</p>

<p>Besides the two constructor variations shown in this example, you can also
define constructors that take an additional <code>String</code> parameter. If
the binding compiler finds a constructor of this type it will pass the name of
the object class that the marshaller/unmarshaller is used with in the binding
when calling the constructor. This feature can be used to implement polymorphic
marshaller/unmarshallers.</p>

<p>If you want to use this custom marshaller/unmarshaller for hashmaps in your
own application you can find it included in <i>jibx-extras.jar</i> with the
name <code>org.jibx.extras.HashMapperStringToComplex</code>. You can also find
several other custom marshaller/unmarshaller classes in the
<code>org.jibx.extras</code> package, including the
<code>org.jibx.extras.TypedArrayMapper</code> that gives an example of
marshaller/unmarshaller polymorphism. I'll also look into ways of making custom
marshaller/unmarshallers even more configurable in the future.</p>

      <h3><a name="frontend">Controlling JiBX with front-end code</a></h3>

<p>Another interesting issue that's come up for several users in the past is the
need to work with multiple versions of XML documents. JiBX has supported this
from the beginning if the versions used different root element names, but this is
not a convenient approach for XML versioning - it's much easier to keep the element
names the same and instead just use an attribute of the root element to specify
the document version.</p>

<p>This makes a good example of controlling the high-level operation of JiBX from
your own code. Below is a partial listing (with constructor and get/set methods
left out) of code that first selects a binding for unmarshalling based on an
attribute of the document root element, then creates an unmarshalling context for
the specific version found and uses that context to unmarshal the document. On the
marshalling side, this uses a supplied version string to select the binding:</p>

<p>To use this binding selection code you need to define a pair of arrays of

name, then create the <code>BindingSelector</code> instance and set the document
to be unmarshalled before finally calling <code>unmarshalVersioned</code> method
to get back the unmarshalled root object:</p>

    private static String[] VERSION_TEXTS = {

    private static String[] VERSION_BINDINGS = {
        "binding0", "binding1", "binding2"
    };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            
            // process input file according to declared version
            BindingSelector select = new BindingSelector(null, "version",
